# Time-Calculator
free CodeCamp Scientific Computing with Python project

https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/scientific-computing-with-python-projects/time-calculator

The goal of this project:

Write a function named add_time that takes in two required parameters and one optional parameter:

-a start time in the 12-hour clock format (ending in AM or PM)
-a duration time that indicates the number of hours and minutes
-(optional) a starting day of the week, case insensitive
The function should add the duration time to the start time and return the result.
